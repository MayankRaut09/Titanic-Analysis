# Titanic Survival Probability Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis project aimed at predicting the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with data modeling and analysis, as well as a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the results.

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Titanic passenger data and provide insights into survival probabilities using machine learning techniques and interactive data visualization. The project is primarily focused on the following components:
A Jupyter Notebook for data modeling and detailed analysis.
A Power BI dashboard for interactive data visualization and exploration.
# Files in the Repository
Titanic_Analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook includes the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models.
Titanic_Survival_Dashboard.pbix: This Power BI file contains the dashboard that visualizes key insights from the analysis.
# Jupyter Notebook Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook includes:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Importing the Titanic dataset and performing necessary cleaning operations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve the predictive models.
Model Development: Building and evaluating different machine learning models to predict survival probabilities.
# Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:

Survival Rate by Class, Gender, and Age: Visualizations that show the survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and age groups.
Interactive Filters: Allows users to filter data based on various criteria to explore different aspects of the dataset.
Key Insights: Highlights important findings from the analysis, such as the impact of socio-economic status on survival.
# How to Use
# Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Titanic_Analysis.ipynb file with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
