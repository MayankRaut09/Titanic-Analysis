# Titanic Survival Probability Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis project aimed at predicting the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook with data modeling and analysis.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze Titanic passenger data and provide insights into survival probabilities using machine learning techniques. The project is primarily focused on the following components:
1. A Jupyter Notebook for data modeling and detailed analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook includes the data processing, analysis, and modeling steps. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models.

## Jupyter Notebook Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook includes:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Importing the Titanic dataset and performing necessary cleaning operations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis of the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the predictive models.
- **Model Development**: Building and evaluating different machine learning models to predict survival probabilities.

## How to Use

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` file with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and models.
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.

## Requirements

- **Python and Jupyter Notebook**: To run the Jupyter Notebook analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic passenger data through detailed data analysis and predictive modeling. The insights derived from this project can help in understanding the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
